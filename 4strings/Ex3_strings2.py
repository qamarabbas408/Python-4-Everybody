##Exercise 5: Take the following Python code that stores a string:
# str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'
# Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the
# colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted
# string into a floating point number.##
str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'
indexofColon=str.find(':')
print(indexofColon)
stripStr=str[19:]
print(stripStr)
